# WikiWeave

What is WikiWeave?

An experiment for me to start learning more about GenAI and see where it takes me.

The simplified idea is this:
- Create a story based on two wikipedia entries
- The app will eventually allow a user to enter two things
  - Look for the best wiki article related to the entries
  - Find the connected graph between the two entries (following linked articles)
  - Using the context from the article path, create a story for how the first entry led to the second entry.

For example if I said Star Wars and Airplanes and the in between article path was:
```
Star Wars --> Space ships --> Rocket science --> Birds --> Flight --> Airplanes.
```
It might output a story about how these each led from Star Wars to Airplanes
